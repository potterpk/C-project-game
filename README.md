Game Hub  is a simple yet engaging console-based gaming platform that offers two classic games for players to enjoy: Tic-Tac-Toe  and Number Guessing Game . Designed with user interaction in mind, this program provides an intuitive menu-driven interface where players can choose between the two games or exit the application. 
Features of Game Hub  

    Main Menu : 
        The main menu serves as the central hub for navigating through the available games.
        Players can select from three options:
            Play Tic-Tac-Toe 
            Play Number Guessing Game 
            Exit the application
             
         

    Tic-Tac-Toe : 
        A classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid.
        The objective is to align three of your marks (either 'X' or 'O') horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win.
        Key Features:
            Clear and visually appealing board display.
            Input validation ensures moves are made within valid cells.
            Detects wins, draws, and invalid moves.
            Displays the winner or declares a draw when appropriate.
             
        After the game ends, players can return to the main menu by pressing Enter.
         

    Number Guessing Game : 
        A fun and interactive guessing game designed for two players.
        One player sets a secret number between 1 and 100, while the other attempts to guess it.
        The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guess was too high or too low.
        Once the correct number is guessed, the total number of attempts is displayed.
        After the game concludes, players can return to the main menu by pressing Enter.
         

    Cross-Platform Compatibility : 
        The clearScreen() function ensures compatibility across different operating systems (Windows, Linux, and macOS) by using system-specific commands (cls for Windows and clear for Unix-based systems).
         

    User-Friendly Design : 
        The program uses a looped menu structure, allowing players to play multiple rounds without restarting the application.
        Invalid inputs are handled gracefully, prompting users to try again.
